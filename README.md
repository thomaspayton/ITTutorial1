1. When you use 3 tic marks it will show the raw code. I will use this throughout the whole tutuorial.

With tics:

```~~ CUT IT ~~````

With out it:

~~CUT IT~~


2. Headers very from 1-6. 1 being the largest heading you can use. All you have to do is put the amouunt of hashtags you want         to use when starting your statement/sentence.

For example:

``` 
# This is the largest text you can use.    
###### This is the smallest text you can use. 
```
Will show: 

# This is the largest text you can use.    
###### This is the smallest text you can use. 


3. Another setting is how to use links to websites. All you have to do is use closed brackets first and put whatever you want in it. Then, put closed parentheses with the link inside.

For example:

```
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com)
```

Will show:

[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com)

4. To put an image in your program, read the following
  
  * First, you insert an Exclamtion point. 
  * Then you insert to brackets and in them you put alt text.
  * Last, in your parantheses you add the image address to what you want the user to preview.
  
All 3 steps together steps put toegther will show:

5. Last but not least in cheats, you can use add charts that show any data below.

Example: 

```
| My            | Name is       |Thomas |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 1             | 2             | 3     |
| !             | @             | #     |
```

Will show:

| My            | Name is       |Thomas |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 1             | 2             | 3     |
| !             | @             | #     |

All these cheats can help any beginner and maybe even someone who may have just forgot.
